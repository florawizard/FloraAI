"""
FloraAI Python Wrapper

This package provides a Python client and utilities to interact with the
FloraAI backend, enabling Python developers to leverage its advanced
agent-based, swarm intelligence, and blockchain capabilities.
"""

# Import key components to make them available when the package is imported.
# For example, if your main client class is FloraAIClient in client.py:
# from .client import FloraAIClient

# Define what gets imported when `from floraai_wrapper import *` is used.
# It's generally good practice to be explicit.
# __all__ = ["FloraAIClient"]  # Add other core classes/functions as needed

# Package version
__version__ = "0.1.0"

# You can also include package-level initialization code here if necessary.
# print("FloraAI Wrapper package initialized.")  # Optional: for debugging or info
